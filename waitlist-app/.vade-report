Implemented Vercel Web Analytics for Next.js

## Summary
Successfully configured Vercel Web Analytics for this Next.js App Router project.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files:
- **app/layout.tsx**: Added Vercel Analytics component to the root layout
  - Imported `Analytics` from '@vercel/analytics/next'
  - Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the ThemeProvider and children components
  
- **package-lock.json**: Updated with minor lockfile resolutions from running `npm install`

## Implementation Details

The project uses:
- Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router with `app` directory)
- npm as the package manager
- The `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) was already installed

The Analytics component was added following Next.js App Router best practices:
1. Imported from '@vercel/analytics/next' (the Next.js-specific integration)
2. Placed at the end of the `<body>` tag in the root layout
3. Positioned after `{children}` and `<ThemeProvider>` to ensure proper page tracking

## Verification

- TypeScript compilation succeeded without errors
- The build process compiled successfully (6.4s compilation time)
- No new linting errors were introduced by our changes
- The Analytics component is now properly integrated and will track page views when deployed to Vercel

## Notes

- The full build failed due to missing Supabase environment variables, but this is a pre-existing issue unrelated to the Analytics implementation
- The compilation phase completed successfully, confirming that the TypeScript code is valid
- Analytics will automatically start collecting data once the app is deployed to Vercel (no additional configuration needed)
