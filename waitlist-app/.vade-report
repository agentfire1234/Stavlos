# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Speed Insights for the Next.js waitlist application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 using npm
- Updated package.json with the new dependency
- Updated package-lock.json to reflect the new package and its dependencies

### 2. Code Integration
Modified: `app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the ThemeProvider children
- The component will automatically collect and send Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics to Vercel

## Implementation Details

The project uses:
- Next.js 16.1.6 (App Router)
- npm as the package manager
- TypeScript

Since the Next.js version is 16.1.6 (> 13.5) and uses App Router, I followed the recommended approach:
- Used the `/next` import path for automatic route detection
- Placed the component in the root layout for site-wide analytics
- No additional props needed as the component auto-detects routes in App Router

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation: Passed (npx tsc --noEmit)
✅ ESLint check on modified file: Passed (no new errors introduced)
✅ Package installation: Successful
✅ Lock file updated: package-lock.json properly updated

Note: Full build failed due to pre-existing Supabase configuration issues (missing environment variables), which are unrelated to these changes. The TypeScript compilation and linting for our specific changes passed successfully.

## Files Modified
- app/layout.tsx - Added SpeedInsights component
- package.json - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- package-lock.json - Updated with new dependency tree

The Speed Insights component is now ready and will start collecting performance metrics once deployed to Vercel.
